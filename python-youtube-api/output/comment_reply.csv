I believe you might have set trigger on the same bucket across more than single lambda function. Can you please make sure the same?",2019-04-11T13:41:55.000Z,0

10,UgyTVk23r4skfF0bKtF4AaABAg,Srce Cde,"Thanks for stopping by.
There is no direct way to export the lambda logs to s3 bucket continuously. But certain tweaks can be done using boto3. You can set a cron job using lambda function that will export the logs periodically.

Another tweak is to set a lambda trigger, that will create the log export task for the specific Lambda function log group. (But I doubt on the accurate results)",2019-01-02T11:28:38.000Z,0
11,Ugwg7KWb0yObZaQMW1l4AaABAg,Srce Cde,"Thanks for stopping by.
You can reuse the same code for the trigger (with minor modification). Upload the image file (instead of txt/csv) and read it on lambda and process.
Give it a try. Let me know if you get stuck.",2018-10-09T05:38:15.000Z,0

14,Ugw7mHAIQEVEO-9Wcn54AaABAg,Srce Cde,"Hi,
I'm glad that it helped you.

I would suggest to go ahead and create role via AWS IAM service. Then create the lambda function and choose existing role; select the one that you created via IAM.

--Create role from templates will definitely create a role for you, but you will never know what happened in background.
--Create custom role will redirect you to IAM, where you can use existing role and modify the policy (JSON) for permission or you can create the new role. In custom role you are required to define permission in JSON policy document.

Hope this helps. Let me know in case you require any further help or it does not answer your question. Thanks",2018-05-20T05:20:38.000Z,0

Please find the CloudFormation template from below link.
https://github.com/srcecde/aws-cloudformation-template/blob/master/S3-Bucket-Lambda-Trigger

Please make sure to edit the source of the code for Lambda and the other needful parameters based on your requirement.

Hope this helps. Thanks.",2018-05-15T05:37:49.000Z,0

I think this video might help to answer your question to read file content from S3 Bucket.

This might help you serving HTML files directly from S3.

19,UgxgvJW13TxCxnnKXM94AaABAg,Srce Cde,"Yes, we can read the content from the file hosted on S3 from Lambda. I believe you can leverage the functionality of beautifulsoup to add dynamic html tags/content. I believe Lambda is powerful and more useful for short computation and not for the server. EC2 can be a good option to run/deploy a server. Hope this helps.",2018-04-02T13:09:34.000Z,0
